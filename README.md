# Automatic-Water-Pump-Switching-with-Irrigation-system-Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In the project, we have explained how to build automatic water pump switching with irrigation system, using 555 timer, relays and sensors by mainly focusing on the purpose of conservative use of water source and agricultural domains.

Water is one of the main resources to be preserved and saved for the future. We use an over- head tank in houses and agricultural fields to store water but, we sometimes forget to turn the motor pump ON\OFF which results to waste of water, so the proposed system of electronics switches the pump ON\OFF automatically as the water level reaches the limit of the storage tank.

Here we are using power supply to run the motor one supply is 240V for the motor to pull the water from the base tank to overhead tank with 12V dc is enough of to run the circuit.

We have added a simple roof top gardening circuit with automatic water dispenser when soil

requires water. In this soil takes the water when it required or when soil get dried for that just an 9v battery is enough to power up the circuit.

They are compatible in size can adjust in small area and this circuit is inexpensive.
